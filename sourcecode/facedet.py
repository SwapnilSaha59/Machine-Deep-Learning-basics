# PARAMETERS FOR FACE DETECTION 
# 
#  cascadeClassifier.detectMultiScale(image, faceDetections, scaleFactor, minNeighbors, flags, minSize, maxSize)
#
# 1.) scaleFactor: Since some faces may be closer to the camera, they would appear bigger
# 		 than other faces in the background -> the scale factor compensates for this
#			
#			Specifying how much the image size is reduced at each image scale
# 			
# 			The model has a fixed size defined during training: in the haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml file !!!
# 			By rescaling the input image, you can resize a larger face to a smaller one,
# 				 making it detectable by the algorithm
# 
# 		Value: 1.1 - 1.4
# 			Small -> algorithm will be slow since it is more thorough
# 			High -> faster detection with the risk of missing some faces altogether
# 
#  2.) minNeighbors: specifying how many neighbors each candidate rectangle should have to retain it
#  			Value interval: ~ 3-6
#  				Higher values -> less detections but with higher quality !!!
#  
#  3.) flags: kind of a heuristic
#  		Reject some image regions that contain too few or too much edges
#  			 and thus can not contain the searched object
#  
#  4.) minSize: objects smaller than that are ignored !!!
#  			We can specify what is the smallest object we want to recognize 
#  					[30x30] is the standard
#  
#  5.) maxSize: objects larger than that are ignored !!!
